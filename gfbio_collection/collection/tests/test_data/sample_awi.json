    "description": "The Aanderaa oxygen optodes are based on the ability of selected substances to act as dynamic fluorescence quenchers. The fluorescent indicator is a special platinum porphyrin complex embedded in a gas permeable foil that is exposed to the surrounding water. A black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water. This sensing foil is attached to a window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight housing. The foil is excited by modulated blue light, and the phase of a returned red light is measured. By linearizing and temperature compensating, with an incorporated temperature sensor, the absolute O2 concentration can be determined.",
